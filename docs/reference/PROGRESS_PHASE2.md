# Phase 2 Implementation Progress: Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Session Started**: 2025-10-15 (Afternoon)
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Graceful Degradation & Adaptive Control

## Purpose

Track Phase 2 implementation progress for dynamic resource allocation. Phase 1 (Error Signaling) is complete and validated. This phase focuses on **reactive control** based on error signals.

**Phase 1 Recap**: ✅ Complete
- Error bus (bounded, lossy)
- Memory detection (cgroup v1/v2, GOMEMLIMIT)
- PSI monitoring (Linux pre-OOM detection)
- Flight recorder (crash forensics)
- Validated in container test (relay-test)

---

## Phase 2 Goals

Build **graceful degradation** mechanisms that respond to error signals:

1. **RED (Random Early Detection)** - Probabilistic early dropping to prevent hard cliffs
2. **AIMD Governor** - Adaptive rate control (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease)
3. **Publish Rate Scaling** - Wire governor output to actual publish rate
4. **Integration** - Control loop that reacts to memory/buffer events

**Key Principle**: React to error signals from Phase 1 to degrade gracefully instead of crashing.

---

## Design Decisions

### RED Configuration

**Defaults** (from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN):
- Min threshold: 0.6 (60% buffer fill)
- Max threshold: 1.0 (100% buffer fill)
- Max drop probability: 0.3 (30% drop rate)

**Rationale**:
- Start dropping before hitting hard limit (60% vs 100%)
- Never drop more than 30% (maintain 70% throughput under pressure)
- Linear ramp provides smooth degradation

### AIMD Configuration

**Defaults** (from config.go):
- Memory enter threshold: 0.70 (70%)
- Memory exit threshold: 0.55 (55%)
- Additive increase: 0.05 per tick
- Multiplicative decrease: 0.5 (half speed on pressure)
- Governor poll interval: 50ms

**Rationale**:
- 15% hysteresis gap (70% → 55%) prevents oscillation
- Slow additive recovery (+5%/tick) prevents overshoot
- Fast multiplicative decrease (×0.5) quickly frees memory
- 50ms poll balances responsiveness vs overhead

### Control Loop Interval

**Default**: 3 seconds (from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN)

**Rationale**:
- Slower than memory monitor (1s) to avoid over-reacting
- Fast enough to respond before OOM (~10s warning)
- Cooldown period (30s) prevents thrashing

---

## Success Criteria

Phase 2 is complete when:

- [ ] RED dropper drops events probabilistically at 60-100% fill
- [ ] AIMD governor scales down to 0.5 at 70% memory pressure
- [ ] AIMD governor scales up to 1.0 after pressure relief
- [ ] Control loop responds to error events within 3s
- [ ] Container stress test survives longer than Phase 1 baseline
- [ ] No OOM kills under stress (graceful degradation instead)
- [ ] Flight recorder shows governor state changes
- [ ] Error events show RED drops and AIMD scale changes

---

## Metrics to Track

**RED Metrics**:
- Events dropped (by RED vs hard limit)
- Drop probability over time
- Buffer fill levels

**AIMD Metrics**:
- Current scale factor
- State (Normal/Degraded/Recovering)
- Time in each state
- Transitions per hour

**System Impact**:
- Throughput reduction under pressure
- Memory peak vs without AIMD
- Time to OOM (with vs without)
- Recovery time after pressure relief

---

## Notes / Issues

*Record blockers, decisions, or important notes*

- RED can be integrated into bus publish path OR as separate layer
- AIMD scale factor needs to affect actual publish rate (TBD: how?)
- Control loop must not block critical path
- Consider async governor updates vs synchronous
