THOUGHTS:

What the trace says
	‚Ä¢	Detection works: you entered DEGRADED at ~70% as designed. ‚úÖ
	‚Ä¢	But the cooldown is bonkers: cooldown: 8333h20m0s ‚Üí that‚Äôs ~0.95 years. That‚Äôs an overflow/units bug. üêõ
	‚Ä¢	Too many scale cuts in one window: at 90.1% you dropped 50% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí 12% within ~100 ms. That‚Äôs not AIMD; that‚Äôs panic-saw. You need ‚Äúone change per control tick‚Äù and a floor. ü™ö
	‚Ä¢	RED wiring is present, but from the logs the drops are not reported; either RED isn‚Äôt hitting yet (no queue pressure) or it isn‚Äôt tied to actual queue fill. RED should be per-queue, not global heap.
	‚Ä¢	Recovery path not shown: you never hit MemRelieved (low-water‚â≤55%) because the stressor kept allocating. That‚Äôs fine for this run, but add a relief phase test to verify ramp-up behavior.

Tight fixes (minimal code moves)

1) Cooldown bug: fix units + sane default

Make cooldown a time.Duration parse or constant‚Äînot ‚Äúseconds as int‚Äù multiplied later.

type GovernorCfg struct {
    PollInterval time.Duration // 50 * time.Millisecond
    Cooldown     time.Duration // 30 * time.Second
    HighFrac     float64       // 0.70
    LowFrac      float64       // 0.55
    MinScale     float64       // 0.20
    AdditiveUp   float64       // +0.05 per tick after relief
    MultDown     float64       // √ó0.50 on pressure
}

If you load from env, parse with time.ParseDuration("30s"). Log both values at startup to catch nonsense.

2) True AIMD: one action per tick, clamp, and hysteresis

You‚Äôre polling every 50 ms. That‚Äôs fine for sensing, but only change scale once per N ticks (e.g., 20 ticks = 1 s), and never more than one multiplicative drop in a single degraded episode.

// inside governor loop
if now.Sub(lastAction) >= cfg.Cooldown {
    switch state {
    case Normal:
        if heapFrac >= cfg.HighFrac {
            scale = max(scale*cfg.MultDown, cfg.MinScale) // e.g., √ó0.5 floor 0.20
            state = Degraded
            lastAction = now
            publish(AdapterThrottl, scale)
        }
    case Degraded:
        if heapFrac <= cfg.LowFrac {
            state = Recovering
            lastAction = now
        } else if severe(heapFrac) && scale > cfg.MinScale {
            // allow one more drop per cooldown window, not back-to-back within 100ms
            scale = max(scale*cfg.MultDown, cfg.MinScale)
            lastAction = now
            publish(AdapterThrottl, scale)
        }
    case Recovering:
        // additive increase with cap per action
        scale = min(scale+cfg.AdditiveUp, 1.0)
        lastAction = now
        if scale >= 1.0 {
            state = Normal
        }
        publish(AdapterUnth, scale)
    }
}

Define severe(h) as, say, h >= 0.90 for ‚â•2‚Äì3 polls to avoid twitchiness.

3) Per-queue RED (not heap-driven)

RED should look at queue fill, not heap. Wire it into your queue Offer:

func (q *Queue) shouldRedDrop() bool {
    fill := float64(len(q.ch)) / float64(cap(q.ch))
    switch {
    case fill < 0.60: return false
    case fill >= 1.00: return true
    default:
        p := ((fill - 0.60) / 0.40) * 0.30 // up to 30%
        return rand.Float64() < p
    }
}

When RED drops, increment a per-adapter drops_red_total and emit a sampled DROP_SLOW event once per second with the latest counters.

4) Pace adapters from scale with a floor

At 10‚Äì12% scale you risk starving yourself. Clamp at MinScale (e.g., 20%) and make pacing proportional, not binary:

// ingress pacing
sleep := time.Duration((1.0-scale) * 300_000) * time.Microsecond // 0..300ms
if sleep > 0 { time.Sleep(sleep) }

5) Prove relief behavior (second phase test)

After you enter DEGRADED and log one throttle event, stop allocating and watch heap fall below LowFrac. Expect:
	‚Ä¢	mem.relief event,
	‚Ä¢	Additive climb: 40% ‚Üí 45% ‚Üí 50% ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí 100% (one step per cooldown),
	‚Ä¢	State transitions: DEGRADED ‚Üí RECOVERING ‚Üí NORMAL.

Add explicit pass/fail checks:
	‚Ä¢	pressure‚Üíthrottle in ‚â§500 ms,
	‚Ä¢	relief doesn‚Äôt fire until heap ‚â§ low for ‚â•2 polls,
	‚Ä¢	scale never drops more than once per cooldown window.

6) Housekeeping (cheap wins)
	‚Ä¢	Log thresholds once: high=140MB low=110MB poll=50ms cooldown=30s.
	‚Ä¢	Include prev_scale in your WORKER_SCALE_DOWN/UP events so diffs are obvious.
	‚Ä¢	Add counters: events_dropped_total{kind}, red_drops_total{adapter}, throttle_seconds_total.

Sensible knobs to start
	‚Ä¢	PollInterval=50ms, Cooldown=30s
	‚Ä¢	HighFrac=0.70, LowFrac=0.55
	‚Ä¢	MultDown=0.5, AdditiveUp=0.05, MinScale=0.20
	‚Ä¢	RED: start at 60% fill, max 30% drop prob at 100% fill.

Why the weirdness happened

Your governor is reading pressure correctly but applying multiple multiplicative decrements with no cooldown, and that year-long cooldown string means your rate limiter wasn‚Äôt actually active. Fix those two and the graph will go from ‚Äúchainsaw‚Äù to ‚Äúsmooth ramp.‚Äù
